I need to find a new home for my Wurlitzer piano! I am leaving NYC for 18 months and need to make space for my subletter's furniture. The piano is in good condition. I am giving it away for free - you just need to arrange moving! Pick up from 113 and Amsterdam. There is an elevator in my building and four stairs from the street level.

$1,225 - New York, New York

Spacious, furnished room in a 2BR apartment, only a 2 minute walk from Columbia's Morningside campus and 10mins from 1, A, B, C, and D trains. 

The room features a comfy bed, a reading nook with a soft chair, a bookshelf, a vanity, and a work/study space. The closet and dresser space is ample, and bedding will be provided. The shared living area is nice and welcoming, suitable both for quiet work/reading and hosting a small gathering. Microwave, coffee machine and blender are available in the kitchen, as well as lots of dishes and pots.

Friendly doormen are around 24-hours, the super lives in the building, and there's the extra perk of not having to take out (household) trash - just leave it in front of the apartment door between 10pm and 7am. The laundry room is in the building.","2017-05-11T01:15:03+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154934733059270&set=gm.1037510319683384&type=3","201945526573205_1037510319683384",NA,0,0,0

Hi! Please feel free to message. I am here until commencement. Venmo is preferred but I would take cash as well (I unfortunately don't have change, though). 

-Emerson 1.7 Cu. Ft Mini Refrigerator ¡V White (pics from Target site). I originally got this for $84.99 almost three years ago ¡V it is in great shape (aesthetically still looks pretty good too) and refrigerates very well, but does tend to accumulate a little water inside every so often. It's been trusty, haven¡¦t had any big leaks or spills. Asking $20. 

-Flashing multicolor LED light Wall Decor (19 in x 10 in) that says ¡§Game Room¡¨ and has a joystick image in the background. Got it for $20; it¡¦s an exclusive item at BBB. Box collected a bit of dust, but never opened. Selling for $15 or OBO. 

-Flowery Adidas snapback. I only tried to wear this once; simply put, my head and hair is way too big, but it is in great condition. Beautiful hat that isn¡¦t easy to find online. Asking $15. 

-Rowenta Effective Comfort DW2070 iron. Open, but box and instructions still available. I ended up having access to another iron so I never ended up using this. Just tested to make sure it works.

$1,500 - New York, NY

Hi all, I'm looking for someone to take over my roommate's lease when he vacates May 15. I'm looking for someone who identifies as very clean, responsible, who will pay the rent on time, and is LGBT-friendly <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00B3><U+FE0F><U+200D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+0088> . The place itself is furnished in all common areas and has a video intercom and buzzer. Monthly rent is $1,500 and does not include internet and electricity/heat (which comes to approx. $100 per month).

This listing is for May 15-July 31 with the possibility of signing a one-year lease after. The apartment is located on Manhattan Avenue between W 111-112 Streets, across the street from Morningside Park, and is no more than a three-minute walk to the Cathedral Pkwy BC stop (and a seven-minute walk to the Cathedral Pkwy 1 stop). The apartment is on the second floor of a walk-up. It¡¦s 750 square feet, has 4 rooms (2 bedrooms, 1 bath, 1 living/dining room near the kitchen area), contains all new appliances (microwave, oven, stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, washer/dryer), and has exposed brick in each room. Your room would be the 9¡¦8¡¨ x 9¡¦7¡¨ room. The current roommate has comfortably fit a queen-sized bed, chest of drawers, TV, shelving, and nightstand in your room. You should be a dog person; I have a 26 lb puppy who stays in the apartment and is the sweetest dog ever.

About me: I'm a recent graduate in Public Health with a puppy in Harlem. I'm a very clean individual who spends an equal amount of time in and out of the apartment. I like to have friends over occasionally, and also love Netflixing on the couch. My dog (a cocker spaniel/dachshund mix) is the sweetest ever and the best cuddle buddy for those long binging sessions. (Also because FB Marketplace thinks I'm trying to sell my dog... the dog is NOT for sale lol <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082> he's just another incentive to live in the apartment)

$1,100 - New York, NY

My roommates and I are subletting our apartment for the summer, available after graduation to mid August (May 22 - Aug 11), with the option of taking over the lease August 15 if you'd like it for the next year. 

It's a 3 bedroom, one bath, full kitchen located 414 W 121rst, literally a block away from campus. We'll leave our furniture there for you so each room is furnished. Laundry is in the basement of the building. Heat and hot water are included. Gas, electric, and internet are not but comes to <$50/month each. 

5 min walk to the 110th subway, Appletree deli/market is right on the corner for groceries and there are plenty of restaurants/food in the immediate area. Can't beat the location in terms of closeness to campus.

Price above is $1100 each person per month, so $3300/month total for the apartment. We'd like to rent the full apartment to a group of three rather than rent room by room. Please PM for more details/pics/schedule a viewing.

$50 - New York, NY

I'm moving out of the city, and as such looking to sell most of my furniture. Most everything at most two years old and in excellent condition. Willing to haggle a bit on prices!

-TV stand (TV not included): $50 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10353765/)
Great condition, holds a large tv, lots of books and movies at bottom.
Happy to also sell the books and movies shown, at best offer.

-Bed (size FULL): $95 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39902942/#/S39902942)
Does NOT have storage underneath (hence the large discount relative to Ikea link); some light wearing off of the black paint near the sides; otherwise in very good shape

-FULL Mattress and Foundation: $250 (https://www.macys.com/shop/product/serta-perfect-sleeper-graceful-haven-12-extra-firm-mattress-collection?ID=4529562&CategoryID=36220#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D25%26ruleId%3D89|BS|AS|BA%26slotId%3D10)

-Five-drawer set: $60 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00261295/)
Basically like new and holds a lot of stuff; can be used with some of Ikea's desk sets to be sed as support for a computer desk

-Table/ desk: $55 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50116809/)
Been using it as my desk though technically a dinner table. Extendable and in very good condition, other than some light wearing off of the black paint in some of the edges (though not too noticeable)

-Three-shelf bookshelf: $15 (https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/way-basics-tool-free-assembly-3-shelf-bookcase-and-storage-shelf-in-natural-wood-grain/1017151053?poc=124039)
Pretty old, and fairly rickety when it¡¦s empty. Feels flimsy but stands up and has held lots of weight for six years straight, very trusty.

-Four-drawer chest drawer: $90 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20360464/#/60360462)
Like new; very solid.

-Step ladder: $25 (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90190411/)

$1,400 - New York, NY

Logistics: July 1st move-in date for a 13-month sublet (and possibility of renewal!). $1400/month, plus internet and electricity.

Location: Unbeatable location in the Lower East Side! You¡¦re close to the hippest restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and art galleries; a short walk to SoHo, NoLita, East Village, Chinatown, and the Bowery, easy access to the East River running path; above a 24-hour empanada restaurant; close to public transport (4 minute walk to B/D at Grand; 4 minute walk to F/J/M/Z at Essex-Delancey; 10 minute walk to the 6 at Spring St; M15 and M15 SBS also close). Everything you could need is within a three-block radius.

The space: A sunny and good-sized room within a cozy 2-bedroom apartment, fully renovated summer 2016! The room has a lot of natural light (2 large windows, plus access to a fire escape you can chill and read a book on, also perfect for catspotting), a ceiling fan, and racks for your clothes on two walls. Very high ceilings, hardwood floors, no street noise. Not much common space in the apartment, but was large enough to fit my piano. Fridge, freezer, kitchen appliances and kitchenware that my roommate is happy to share with you so you don¡¦t have to buy your own! Large tiled shower in the bathroom. It¡¦s on the 3rd floor in a pre-war walkup. Because I¡¦m moving to the west coast, willing to give you a great deal on any of my furniture that you might want (bedframe, mattress, large dresser with mirror, bookcase, flat-screen TV, clothing rack, storage chair) or have the room unfurnished. AC unit included!

Roommate: The roommate is my good friend of six years, who¡¦s a 2016 grad of UChicago and works at an education nonprofit on a fellowship program supporting higher education in Africa. She cooks daily, and would be happy to cook with/for you as well! She spends her time outside of work running, going to yoga and Zumba classes at the very affordable gym that¡¦s only three blocks away, and doing foreign policy activist work.  She loves empanadas, watching TV with friends, and exploring the city. She¡¦s friendly, respectful, and keeps common spaces clean. She¡¦s looking for someone fun but who doesn¡¦t want to throw ragers every weekend, and is down for nights of watching TV in the apartment. She¡¦s a great roommate and friend!

More logistics: 1 month security deposit, very slightly flexible move-in date, no smoking, no cats (because of allergies, but dogs ok and cat memes encouraged). Message me if you're interested!","2017-05-06T19:54:27+0000","status",NA,"201945526573205_1032920743475675",NA,1,0,0

$2,000 - New York, NY

Hey friends, I'm looking to sublet my exorbitant apartment on the top floor of a Riverside Dr. elevatored apartment building with views of the Hudson and Jersey.

I am seeking a very clean male for mid-May until end of August. Rent is $2000/month, which includes everything: gas, electric, and the highest-grade internet we could get.

The bedroom is approximately 450 square foot. This outrageously large room features a 2 month old Queen size bed of medium firmness, a super comfy couch in the separate TV area, remote control lights, fur blankets and fur accents, bespoke curtains featuring my family tartan, large closet and tie rack, large mirror, shoe rack and a work desk. There is a brand new remote controlled 10,000 BTU air conditioner for those hot NYC days, and since you don't pay utilities you can run it all day!

The unreasonably spacious apartment features a large kitchen with everything. If you like to cook, this is a dream. Friends often come over to use the kitchen because it's so big (which means free food for me). This is a 3 bedroom apartment. The other 2 roommates are both military veterans and very clean and respectful, but at the same time mad chill. There is a separate living room where we have hosted friends. The bathroom is the smallest space, but still has plenty of room and has a powerful large shower.

The building's residents are very friendly and it has laundry in the basement. It is located two blocks from the 125th One Stop. There is a dry cleaner on our corner and many delicious restaurants and convenient shops including Duane Reade in the neighborhood. Across the street is Grant's Tomb, Sakura Park and Riverside Park are within a block, and Riverside Church is a block away. Columbia campus is a short 10 minute walk with beautiful views on the way.

Please, message me if you're interested in setting up a time to come and see the apartment.","2017-05-05T02:23:07+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1686771561363817&set=gm.1031018603665889&type=3","201945526573205_1031018603665889",NA,3,0,0

$50 - New York, NY

Beginning to study for the MCAT? I am selling my complete Kaplan 2015 (newest addition) books + flashcards (which are super helpful for psych/soc!) for $50. 
I can bring the books to campus next week OR I'll give you $10 if you pick them up in Brooklyn.
Also, I took a Kaplan live-online class this fall and they re-enrolled me for another class this summer (which I don't need to take). The class is real time and goes from August 15-August 31, every day of the week except weekends. I found it very helpful. I would be willing to sell my class account for a VERY discounted price. If you took it, you would have access to 11 Kaplan full-length exams, 3 AAMC FLs, AAMC question banks, and a Kaplan question bank of 2000+ Qs. Essentially, you would be set for MCAT materials. You would have access to the class materials immediately and they would expire in September. Message me for more details.

This is one of the best and most popular swings, and it is easy to see why. Not only is it attractive and technologically advanced, but it is created to move the way that you would while holding your baby and rocking her to sleep. If you¡¦re looking for a great swing to keep your baby happy, comfortable and most importantly asleep, then this could be the swing you are looking for.
The 4moms, mamaRoo, Baby Swing has five unique motions that are created to mimic the movements of parents while they are comforting their babies, and these include: car rides, kangaroo bouncing, swinging, rocking and waving. If your baby is fussy when she isn¡¦t constantly being picked up or moved around, then this swing could help save your arms (and gas costs) from running low.
This baby swing is great and technologically advanced. It is even bluetooth enabled so you can control the motion and sounds that the swing makes for your little one simply by connecting it to any bluetooth device like your smartphone.

4moms - mamaRoo Infant Seat Swing, Black:
Age range: birth until child weighs 25 lbs or can sit up
Discontinue use once child can sit up unassisted
Maximum weight limit: 25 lbs
Features built-in nature sounds and an MP3 hookup
3 reversible toy balls patterned after classical artists
Fabric is easy to remove and machine washable

For any special occasion you might have. Should fit dress size 8 or 10 depending on your shape. Extremely flattering for lots of body shapes. I'm 5'7'' and the dress is the perfect length but can easily be hemmed for someone who is shorter. Has tulle + silk lining so you feel all princess-y. Dress was altered in bust.

$400 - New York, NY

This is a posting for a new, open-box Sealy Posturepedic Hybrid Copper Cushion Firm Mattress, Queen.
I am selling it because it is too soft for me - it has a very nice pillow-top layer, but it looks like I need to stick with extra-firm mattresses instead.
This mattress normally retails for $1599 on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KJ0Q9XW), but since I've opened it and tossed the box out in my excitement, it can be yours for only $399 (or make me an offer!).
Guaranteed to be clean, it's been leaning against my wall, unused, with a sheet on top of it to protect it from dust.
You are 100% responsible for pick up and transportation of the QUEEN sized mattress (79 x 60 x 13.5 inches). Bring a friend or some help and a large vehicle. I will not be able to help you move it.","2017-04-27T01:54:20+0000","link","https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KJ0Q9XW","201945526573205_1023111967789886",NA,0,0,0

$100 - New York, NY (10027)

Selling my Audio-Technica studio headphones. I've had these for a little over a year now, but they are in perfect condition. They are comfortable, they look pretty cool, and of course, the sound quality is amazing - they are studio headphones, after all. In my opinion, the only downside of these headphones is that the wire doesn't have the in-line mic controls for pausing or changing volume.

I bought them for around $200, and I'm selling them for half the price. $100 gets you the headphones plus the case. PM me if you want to buy or have any questions.

Hi Everyone,

Are you in need of a pet sitter in the city, but NYC pet boarding prices make you cry? Look no further!

My friends, Victoria Baamonde and Ian Harper (whom I met while working at a doggy daycare), have started their own business and they and their team can be counted on to provide some top-quality care to your beloved pets while you are away (at FANTASTIC prices)!

My little dog Panda, who is my #1 love, gives nothing but nonstop kisses and spastic, furious tail wags at the sight of Vic & Ian, which is all the proof I need to know that she had a blast while they looked after her for me!

Check it out today and share with all your NYC friends!

Selling my MacBook Air Mid-2013 13-inch for slow use/parts.

The computer works, but after getting diagnostics run I found out the logic board is going out and it would be too much for me to replace it. The computer's screen works great, keyboard has no problems, battery is great, body has only slight scratches on the back. I had it inscribed with a NYPD serial number from Campus Safety on the back in case it was stolen, so I will call and switch over ownership to you when we are together.

Includes the original packaging and charger. $450 OBO. Would love to sell before Spring Break!

$60 - New York, NY (10027)

Hi all, it's your favorite Columbia refrigerator salesman again.

I'm selling my fridge for $60. It works for me if someone can pick it up ASAP.

It's the fucking rolls royce of dorm fridges (huge and has a separate freezer that actually works), and I contend it's worth a lot more than $60 but time is running out and I need it gone.

Here are the details:

It's a Vissani 4.3 cu ft Mini Refrigerator and has a large, separate freezer compartment.

It's 43in x 20in x 20 in (fits into any corner) and plugs into any normal wall outlet. There's an internal light that comes on when you open the door. It's very spacious and helped save me a lot of money by going off the meal plan. The size is optimal for 1-2 people living in a dorm/apartment.

The company re-branded so the current model is actually called a 'Magic Chef', but the two are identical. You can look up the specs and read the reviews on it at this link: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Magic-Chef-4-3-cu-ft-M¡K/205429705

Malcolm X embodied service and was vocal about inequality and black empowerment in the very streets and neighborhoods we walk around daily. It is our duty as members of the community to do the same and give back in the same light as Brother Malcolm. Thus on February 18th we are collecting non-perishable goods and walking the same streets of Harlem giving away free food to those that are hungry in our city. We will be donating any leftover food items to pantries to continue this work.

"1851","10152529434349276","Scully Granger","Hi all, I live uptown manhattan (wash heights) As of yesterday I had to file for temporary disability from my full-time job, and so I'm not bringing home my (already pretty abysmal) paycheck until I'm back on my feet.

I'm *officially* confined to bedrest but functionally I'm not 100% good at the bedrest thing. (I'm a hyperenergetic social worker who isn't good at twiddling my thumbs).

I'd love if people wanted to hire me for odd jobs like:
1. petsitting (if you're really close by)
2. music lessons at my house (piano, violin, viola, voice)
3. helping you figure out your paperwork / insurance stuff. 
4. writing copy, doing minor graphic design work, etc. 
5. potentially some babysitting depending on age and activity level and location

Also! I have written some books that I'd absolutely love to sell. The list is attached. Or, if you'd like a free copy in exchange for a review on Amazon, I'm happy to message a PDF to you! Just message me.
thanks future friends <3
